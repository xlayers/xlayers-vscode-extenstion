## What is the xLayers - VSCode plugin

The xLayers - VSCode plugin is a community-driven effort to bridge the gap between designers, who implement the UI sketch and developers who implement the code from these design sketches. Put simply, the xLayers - VSCode plugin is a code generation tool for your design sketches. It will help developers in their day to day work, by converting sketch files easily to their favorite framework without leaving their favorite IDE.

The xLayers projects are driven by community contributions. Please send us your Pull Requests and feedback!
